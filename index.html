<h2>This is a Journal</h2>

<h4>To help organize my thoughts, stay focused in the moment, and learn a new skill. It's also a creative outlet, I suppose. Like 90's nostalgia art but in a live format. I could also try out some writing on various topics here, develop some characters, etc. I wouldn't even have to publish it, just the thought of putting it on the internet would be a stimulus for me to write.</h4>

<h5>I could even try out a zettelkasten type system on here and see if that helps. I could post practice writing and language materials here. I could try editing and formatting my pictures that I take into something useable ona simple web page. I could even make a Zine or something using tools from the retro web and what I learn during this experiment.</h5>

<p><h4>Quotes and testimonials for the 'net: <br>"[When I'm on the 'net,] I'm EXACTLY like an anime waifu on a low fi 24/7 online radio stream cover"</h4><p>

<h6>I could artistically make <a href="links.html">>webpages</a>, dabble in pixel art, make fake webpages like fake companies, fake clubs, fake advertisements etc. Like a wholly formed world I've created within this website, basically. I could even try to layer on various forms of story on top of it as a framing device.

what happens to the links that don't form. like you reference a page in your document but then the document it refers to doesen't exist yet. if you clicked it in this state it would say it's a broken link. but if you intend to link it that means it's not a broken link, it's just a link that hasn't been formed yet. so temporally you- the clicker are not clicking a broken link, you are clicking a potential link that will form (or maybe will not) some time in the past or future but not right at this moment (the now). isn't that like forming new realtities? when you decide to link a document at last theoretically the contents of that docuement are endless. you could spawn a whole new
 world. or if you just leave a document there to languish? what is that? what happens to all the potentialities that could have been? were they created? did they ever exist?

<p> alternatively I could just mandatorily post whatever I create in this webpage hellscape into a public spectacle. that might actually be the best option, although I'm afraid at what the outcome may be. . .</p></h6>
